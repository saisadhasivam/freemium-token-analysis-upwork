# Freemium Token Model Analysis: Are Global Platforms Affordable?

This project analyzes the effectiveness and fairness of token-based freemium models (like Upwork, Lovable, etc.) that give limited free credits to users.  
We evaluate whether these models encourage daily active usage or unintentionally cause drop-offs — especially for users from low-income regions.

---

## Problem Statement

Platforms like **Upwork** and **Lovable** use a **freemium + credit/token model**:

- New users get **limited free tokens** (e.g., connections or interactions)
- Once exhausted, users must **pay to continue** using core features

Many users, especially from developing countries, sign up but drop off after hitting these limits.

> **Key question:**  
Is this model *affordable* and *sustainable* across different income regions?

---

## Project Objectives

1. Analyze **token pricing & usage rules** of global platforms  
2. Collect **real-world income & cost-of-living data** per country  
3. Simulate **user behavior** (free use, upgrade, churn)  
4. Build an **Affordability Index**: can users afford to stay?  
5. Generate **recommendations** for global freemium pricing

## Data Lifecycle

We follow a 7-step data science lifecycle:

1. **Business Understanding** – Define the problem and hypotheses  
2. **Data Collection** – Real-world token pricing + income stats  
3. **Data Preparation** – Clean, transform, and integrate datasets  
4. **EDA** – Visualize user flow, pricing pressure, and country-wise costs  
5. **Modeling** – Simulate churn and engagement patterns  
6. **Evaluation** – Check fairness and friction across regions  
7. **Deployment** – Generate PDF report + publish case study

## 🧰 Tools We Will Use

- **Python**: pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, sklearn  
- **Jupyter Notebook**: for EDA, modeling, and simulation  
- **Excel / Google Sheets**: for manual entry and pricing matrices  
- **GitHub**: to version control and publish our project  
- **Notion**: to document hypotheses and ideas  
- **LinkedIn**: to publish the final case study for professional exposure

## Data Ethics & Assumptions

- This project uses simulated and publicly available data.
- We do not represent or misuse any internal company data.
- Token models are inferred based on user experience and publicly visible pricing.
- Simulated behaviors are designed for analytical purposes only.

## Why This Project Matters

Freemium token-based pricing is common in SaaS, freelancer platforms, and AI tools.  
But many users in developing countries experience friction — they run out of credits quickly and can't afford subscriptions.  

> **We aim to answer:**  
> Are these platforms globally inclusive or accidentally exclusive?

By combining real-world income data, platform pricing, and simulated usage patterns, this project provides insights that go beyond dashboards.  
We recommend business strategies that balance monetization with accessibility.
